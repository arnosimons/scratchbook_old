# ScratchBook OLD --> Please check my newer ScratchBook <a href="https://github.com/arnosimons/scratchbook/" target="_blank">Repro</a> and <a href="https://www.scratchbook.app" target="_blank">website</a>.

This repro builds on the <a href="https://www.ttm-dj.com/" target="_blank">turntablist transcription methodology (TTM)</a>, developed by John Carluccio, Ethan Imboden, and DJ Raedawn, and it makes two distinct contributions to the turntablism community:

1) It provides tools to represent, transform, combine, and visualize scratches 
2) It provides a comprehensive library of popular and possible scratches

If you have questions or feedback, please pm me :)
