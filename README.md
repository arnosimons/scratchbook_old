# ScratchBook

This repro builds on the <a href="https://www.ttm-dj.com/" target="_blank">turntablist transcription methodology (TTM)</a>, developed by John Carluccio, Ethan Imboden, and DJ Raedawn, and it makes two distinct contributions to the turntablism community

1) It provides tools to represent, transform, combine, and visualize scratches 
2) It provides a comprehensive library of popular and possible scratches

If you have questions or feedback, please pm me :)
