# ScratchBook

This repro builds on the [turntablist transcription methodology (TTM)](https://www.ttm-dj.com/about-us-2/), developed by John Carluccio, Ethan Imboden, and DJ Raedawn, and it makes two distinct contributions to the turntablism community:

1) It provides tools to represent, transform, combine, and visualize scratches 
2) It provides a comprehensive library of popular and possible scratches
